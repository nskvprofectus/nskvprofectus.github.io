In the academic year of 2015-2016, a handful of strength sports enthusiasts founded NSKV Profectus. The mission was clear from the start: to develop and foster a community of like-minded individuals with a passion for strength sports. There were several important pivotal moments in the history of Profectus, which helped shape the association we know today. For example, we were able to work close together for multiple years with a national-level powerlifting coach. In addition, NSKV Profectus was able to collaborate with the Radboud Sports Centre in finding and purchasing additional top-of-the-line equipment, such as Eleiko competition barbells and calibrated weights. Year after year, our community evolved and eventually matured into a fully fletched student sports association, over 60 members strong!
